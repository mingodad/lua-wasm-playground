# A web playground with Lua interpreter compiled to wasm

Here is an amalgamation of Lua 5.4.4, https://github.com/sqmedeiros/lpeglabel and https://github.com/edubart/lpegrex compiled to wasm that can be viewed at https://mingodad.github.io/lua-wasm-playground/ .

The playground website is based on https://yhirose.github.io/cpp-peglib/ and also with modifications based on https://chrishixon.github.io/chpeg/playground/ .
